            <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
            <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, bacon (pancetta or guanciale), and black pepper.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz (225g) spaghetti</li>
                <li>4 slices bacon (pancetta or guanciale), chopped</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain well, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove bacon from skillet and drain on paper towels, leaving the bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan cheese, and Pecorino Romano cheese. Season with black pepper.</li>
                <li>Return the skillet with the bacon fat to low heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add cooked spaghetti to the skillet and toss to coat with the bacon fat and garlic.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.</li>
                <li>Add crispy bacon to the pasta and toss to combine. Season with additional black pepper and salt if needed.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
